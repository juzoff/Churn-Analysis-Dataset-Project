**Note: This project is organized into multiple branches on GitHub, each correlating with a different portion of the assignment. To explore specific sections, please select the branch that corresponds to the task or analysis you are interested in. This structure allows for a focused review of each component of the project, making it easier to follow along with the data preparation, modeling, and evaluation processes.**

**Data Collection:**

*   I started by obtaining the Churn dataset, which includes customer demographics, account information, and whether they churned (i.e., canceled their subscription/service).

**Data Preparation:**

*   **Data Cleaning:** I cleaned the data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. I also encoded categorical variables and normalized numerical features to ensure the data was ready for analysis.
*   **Handling Special Characters:** I renamed columns and handled special characters in the dataset to ensure compatibility with different software tools and to prevent potential issues during analysis. This step was crucial for ensuring that all variable names were standardized and properly recognized by the coding environment.
*   **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** I conducted EDA to understand the data distribution, relationships between variables, and key patterns. This included visualizing the data by plotting various charts in an Excel spreadsheet for better insights. Additionally, I plotted the correlation among attributes to evaluate weak, moderate, and strong correlational relationships.
*   **Class Distribution Analysis:** I assessed whether the dataset had an imbalanced class distribution by examining the proportion of records for different classes. It was determined that the dataset required balancing, which was addressed as part of the data preparation process.

**Documentation and Reporting:**

*   **Documentation and Reporting:** I documented the entire process, including code, methodology, and results, to ensure the project could be easily understood and replicated by others.
