**Visualizing Insights, Conclusions, and Recommendations:**

*   **Visualization of Insights:** I created visualizations to present the key findings and recommendations clearly. This included charts and graphs that highlighted trends in customer behavior, churn rates, and the impact of different factors on churn likelihood.
*   **Dashboard Creation:** A comprehensive dashboard was developed using Tableau to provide stakeholders with an interactive tool for exploring the data. This dashboard included visualizations of key metrics, such as churn rates segmented by customer demographics and service usage patterns.
*   **Actionable Insights:** Each visualization was accompanied by insights that guide strategic decision-making, making it easier for stakeholders to understand the implications of the findings and the recommended actions to mitigate churn.
